My solutions of  [Lucid Programming Competition](https://lucid.co/programming-competition) problems. All the solution code has been written in $C++$. The goal of this repository is not only share the solution code, but also sharing the my ideas and approaches towards the solution.

I have participated in this contest in 2021 for the first time. I will try to attend the previous competitions off-line and share the solution ideas with you in future.
